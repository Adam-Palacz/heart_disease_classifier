# heart_disease_classifier
Machine Learning project aimed at creating models for classifying death from heart disease.
In the project created many classification models and compared their results such as accuracy, precision , recall and f1 score.

Models used:
* Logistic Regression
* Suport Vector Classification
* K-Nearest Neughbors Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier 
* Bagging Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Ada Boost Classifier
* XGB Classifier
* Cat Boost Classifier
* Artificial Neural Network

Best results (still needing significant improvement):
* Accuracy - 85% (Cat Boost Classifier)
* Precision - 85,71% (Bagging Classifier)
* Recall - 75% (Artificial Neural Network)
* F1 score - 75,68 % (Cat Boost Classifier)
